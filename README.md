# FF! Randomized Auto Splitter for LiveSplit
Currently being tested, needs FCEUX 2.2.3 - currently seems to run right with all tested roms on my PC, looking for people to test it out

How to use this:
* Download the .asl file and put it somewhere you will remember (in your LiveSplit folder might be a good option)
* right click and select Edit Layout on you livesplit overlay
* click the plus and under control, add a Scriptable Auto Splitter
* Browse to the .asl file you downloaded from here
* Toggle any settings you wish
* Now you timer should start when you press A after naming your characters and split on getting an item if you have it selected in the settings
